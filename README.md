# hello-world
my first code basement.
Sooo hello there folks! i'm mike a guy who has recently picked up what seems like an obsession.right now i've only got to css and html. i'm working on javascript but so far no go. (i refuse to be a cut and paster) so i'll be here on github bumming for help like that guy by your local beer and cigarette store.
